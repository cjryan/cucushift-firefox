cucushift-firefox
=================

A firefox extension for extending TCMS capabilities. It will allow a user to view scenario files directly on GitHub, file JIRA reports, and show, in TCMS runs, who the developer is based on the 'Notes' field.

This extension was built using the [Mozilla Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).

In order to build this extension as a .xpi file, to install into firefox, please install the SDK, clone the cucushift-firefox repo, and in the repository, run `cfx xpi`. This will generate an .xpi file that can be installed via the Firefox Addons page.
