cucushift-firefox
=================

A firefox extension for making jenkins output more legible and for extending TCMS capabilities

This extension was built using the [Mozilla Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).

In order to build this extension as a .xpi file, to install into firefox, please install the SDK, clone the cucushift-firefox repo, and in the repository, run `cfx xpi`. This will generate an .xpi file that can be installed via the Firefox Addons page.

You can also install the [pre-built .xpi](https://github.com/cjryan/cucushift-firefox/blob/master/cucushift-firefox.xpi) found in this repository.
