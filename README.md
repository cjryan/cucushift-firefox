cucushift-firefox
=================

A firefox extension for extending TCMS (Nitrate) capabilities. This extension will allow a user to view cucumber scenario files directly on GitHub, file JIRA issues, and show, in TCMS runs, who the developer is based on the 'Notes' field.

This extension was built using the [Mozilla Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).

You can find a prebuilt .xpi file to install in [the builds folder](https://github.com/cjryan/cucushift-firefox/raw/master/builds/cucushift-firefox.xpi)

In order to build this extension as a .xpi file, to install into firefox, please install the SDK as linked above, clone the cucushift-firefox repo, and in the repository, run `cfx xpi`. This will generate an .xpi file that can be installed via the Firefox Addons page.
