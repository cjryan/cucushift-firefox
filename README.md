cucushift-firefox
=================

A firefox extension for making jenkins output more legible and for extending TCMS capabilities

This extension was built using the [Mozilla Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK).

In order to build this extension as a .xpi file, to install into firefox, please install the SDK, clone the cucushift-firefox repo, and in the repository, run `cfx xpi`. This will generate an xpi file that can be installed via the Firefox Addons page.
